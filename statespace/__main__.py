"""what's it all about? basically, interesting and important applications of computing in the 40s, 50s,
and 60s - stuff that really drove forward those early generations of hardware, and what eventually became known as
software - what some of the machines in the old film clips were actually doing, and why fortran was such a big deal -
tons of large scale linear algebra - so floating-point matrix and vector operations, zero allowance for character
strings. a fundamental divide between numerical computing and everything else - if you cared about strings,
you became a cobol person - which was at the root of the divide between the fortran/c/cpp/python tradition and the
cobol/lisp/java/everything-else tradition. if your stuff had to do with super-computing or embedded-real-time,
you were in the former - otherwise, not.

the beginnings for our purposes are dantzig and von neumann linear programming - all woven through operations
research around the time of the transition from mechanical to digital computing - let's say, early cold war. one of
the things kalman brought in on top of this was nonlinear elements capable of representing uncertainty - the classic
covariance matrix quadratic form ATAx. this was happening across fields, as the same appeared in finance via
markowitz portfolio theory at the same time - what was driving all this organic evolution was the increasing floating
point computing power - flops - and the ability to harness it via fortran. and the impact was immediate - let's say
high cold war - late 50s early 60s - with the early integrated circuitry of the apollo guidance computer and
minuteman missile guidance system. how do you get your life-or-death automated control systems to make better
decisions? the birth of machine learning - adaptive closed-loop feedback control.

here's a fun story illustrating this evolution. high cold war - increasing flops and fortran drive the appearance of
covariance matrices in what was purely linear optimization - but we're definitely on the edge here, because those
quadratic forms immediately blow up our numerical ranges - there's a crescendo of cries - numerical instability! we
don't have enough bits in our floating point representations - plain and simple. so what immediately happens is a new
industry within applied mathematics and electrical engineering - optimize the fortran and floating point units,
and factorize the matrices. what does factorize the matrices mean? in a nutshell, only represent something very much
like their square roots - at least internally within our computations. all of this dominates the 60s, 70s,
and 80s - let's say high cold war onward through baroque/neo-classical cold war - the era when the name 'cray'
inspired awe. one of our objectives here in project statespace is a straightforward minimalistic representation of
the real-world factorized forms, alongside the classic textbook forms. names like thornton and bierman aren't widely
remembered today - but without the factorized form 'square root' ekf, the apollo guidance computer wasn't possible at
that time - and they were crucial for the transit/gps satnav systems as well. if you know about ud decomposition,
cholesky decomposition, singular value decomposition, etc - then you know."""
