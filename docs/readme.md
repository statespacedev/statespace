ukf adaptive jazwinksi switched to square-root filtering, qr-factorizaion, cholesky-factor update and downdate. improved numerical stability and scaled sampling is clear. still a question around scalar-obs and the obs cholesky-factor and gain. with an adhoc stabilizer on the obs cholesky-factor it's working well overall.
