models
==================================================================================================================

will probably be moving towards a higher-level statespace model, encompassing specific lower-level models - possibly something involving a translator / converter / adaptor... the models here are already an extrememly primitive form of that - making them as similar as possible from the perspective of the classical, modern, particle processors. we can think about these becoming specific cases of something more fundamental.
